Please add any controversial terms to this file to aid future decisions during Documentation or UI translation.


Want to contribute? Like to be in the loop? Feel free to  [join Telegram group]() where we discuss Obsidian translation in Persian / Farsi.


Because Persian is an RTL (Right-To-Left) language and there is no official support for such languages in Obsidian yet, we prefer to translitrate the proper nouns in order to avoid issues. As soon as Obsidian team adds support for RTL we will write these terms in their original form.


Please keep the term list **alphabetically sorted**.
