Thank you for your interest in translating Obsidian. Please add any controversial terms to this file to aid future decisions during documentation or UI translation, thus creating a consistent experience.  

Obsidian is constantly under development and as new features are added, so is more text. If you find any term that is not translated yet, feel free to name it. In the language package file (de.json), we have different text strings for singular and plural nouns. If you have to translate a word, keep that in mind since it can create some inconsistencies.  

In doubt, feel free to ask our amazing community for their opinion in the [Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/veuWUTm) (We have a special German channel!).  

Please keep the term list **alphabetically sorted**.
